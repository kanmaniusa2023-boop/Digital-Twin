# Digital-Twin
This project builds LLM powered digital twins, interactive persona agents that run focus group style evaluations of your product with transparent logged reasoning. Provide a persona configuration and product brief; the system injects context, runs Q and A, and outputs needs, trade offs, and recommendations with transcripts and metrics for analysis.
